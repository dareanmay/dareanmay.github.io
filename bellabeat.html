                        <h1>Bellabeat Case Study &#127939;</h1>
                        <p>A Capstone Project from the Google Data Analytics Certification</p>
                    </header>

                    <p>The second case study in the last course of the Google Data Analytics program provides an
                        opportunity for students to practice the knowledge and skills learned in the program by creating
                        a data-driven marketing strategy for <a href="bellabeat.com" target = "_blank">Bellabeat</a>, a high-tech
                        manufacturer of health-focused products for women.</p>
                    <p>For this case study, I focused on gaining insights on the profile and habits of users of smart
                        health devices that can influence how they would use one of Bellabeat’s products – the Spring
                        bottle.</p>
                    <p>This data analysis is guided by the six steps of the data analysis process: <i>ask, prepare,
                            process, analyze, share, and act</i>.</p>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <h2>Scenario</h2>
                    <p>In this case study, I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at
                        Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Based on the given
                        scenario, I identified my three main tasks for this data analysis:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how
                            consumers are using their smart devices.</li>
                        <li>Gain insights to help guide marketing strategy for the company.</li>
                        <li>Present high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <h2>Product</h2>
                    <p>The Bellabeat products specified in the given data analysis scenario are the Bellabeat app, the
                        Leaf wellness tracker, the Time wellness watch, the Spring smart water bottle, and the Bellabeat
                        membership.</p>
                    <p>I was tasked to focus on one Bellabeat product. For this analysis, I am interested on the <a
                            href="https://support.bellabeat.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000738905-Spring" target = "_blank">Bellabeat
                            Spring water bottle</a>. My goal is to gain insights on the health profile of users to learn
                        important information on physical activity and water intake.</p>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <h2>Ask</h2>
                    <h3>Business task</h3>
                    <p>As a junior data analyst, I am expected to analyze data on the use of smart health and fitness
                        devices to provide data-driven insights on how Bellabeat can improve its marketing strategy.</p>
                    <h3>Key stakeholders</h3>
                    <p>The following are the key stakeholders considered in the case study:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><u>Urška Sršen</u>: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer</li>
                        <li><u>Sando Mur</u>: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat
                            executive team</li>
                        <li><u>Bellabeat marketing analytics team</u>: A team of data analysts responsible for
                            collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <h2>Prepare</h2>
                    <h3>Data source</h3>
                    <p>The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit" target = "_blank">FitBit Fitness Tracker Data</a>
                        from Kaggle was recommended by the stakeholders. Despite some limitations, I decided to focus
                        the data analysis to this dataset for now. The dataset is licensed under the CC0: Public Domain.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Data credibility</h3>
                    <p>The dataset is generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk
                        between 03.12.2016 - 05.12.2016. The survey included 30 respondents, which is the minimum number
                        of samples to glean reliable findings. However, there is limited information based on important
                        demographics that is relevant to the analysis. Additional data such as age and gender can
                        improve the analysis since Bellabeat’s products are focused on women.</p>
                    <h3>Data organization</h3>
                    <p>This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty FitBit users. Thirty eligible
                        Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output
                        for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily
                        activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.</p>
                    <p>The data set contains 18 CSV files. Some files contained merged information from other files
                        included in the data set. Wide and narrow formats are available for some CSV files. Most files
                        are categorized based on frequency: minute, hourly, and daily.</p>
                    <h3>Data sorting and filtering</h3>
                    <p>For the sake of the data analysis, only relevant data sets are going to be used. It can be
                        observed that some data sets contain similar and redundant information, so this was also
                        considered. The following data sets are chosen and will be sorted and filtered out further in
                        the next stage of the data analysis:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>weightLogInfo_merged.csv</li>
                        <li>dailyActivity_merged.csv</li>
                        <li>hourlyIntensities_merged.csv</li>
                    </ol>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <h3>RStudio</h3>
                    <p>The data analysis was done mainly on <b>RStudio</b>.</p>

                    <h3>Findings</h3>
                    <p>The following are the insights gained based on the results of the data analysis:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Most of the participants in the data set live a sedentary lifestyle. 81.61% of participants
                            are physically inactive throughout the day.</li>
                        <li>On average, participants engage in the most intense physical activities during Saturdays at
                            1 PM. Based on top findings, participants are most active on afternoons and early in the
                            evening during Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday.</li>
                        <li>From the average weight of the participants, around 2.5 liters of water should be consumed
                            daily. If factoring in 30 minutes of physical activity throughout the day, almost half a
                            liter should be added in (2.9 liters). Expressing these quantities as number of Spring
                            bottles, around 5-6 bottles should be consumed on a daily basis.</li>

                    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                    <p>Based on the findings of my analysis, I listed marketing strategies and practices that Bellabeat
                        stakeholders can consider. The recommendations listed below are mostly digital marketing
                        strategies since the company has extensively built their online presence. In addition to this, I
                        have also listed notes on possible product improvement and future analysis efforts.</p>

                    <b>Bellabeat marketing strategy</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>It is a concerning fact that most of the participants in the data set live a sedentary
                            lifestyle. The marketing team can effectively advertise the importance of their products by
                            putting an emphasis on the findings gained from this case study. The following are specific
                            steps they can do:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Launch an awareness campaign on their online platforms about the importance of
                                    living an active lifestyle. Highlight the findings from this case study and include
                                    how Bellabeat products can help by monitoring daily physical activity.</li>
                                <li>Using the Bellabeat app and Leaf tracker, the company can specifically target users
                                    who are sedentary and encourage them to be more active through customized reminders
                                    or advertising.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The stakeholders can now consider the insights gained from the time and day users are
                            engaging in more intense physical activities in their marketing strategies. The following
                            can be considered:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Users are most likely to use their products when they are engaging in physical
                                    activity. The team can consider to put out more advertising on their online
                                    platforms or in their Bellabeat application during these times.</li>
                                <li>The team can put out more exercise-related notifications like hydration during times
                                    of frequent and intense physical activity.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Putting the recommended average water intake into consideration, the team can implement ways
                            to encourage users to hydrate. For example:
                            <ul>
                                <li>An online ad campaign that visualizes how many Spring bottles they should consume on
                                    average daily can help users understand better the quantity of water that they
                                    should be drinking.</li>
                                <li>The team can design customized hydration goals in their application based on the
                                    weight and physical activity profile of users. Using the tracking capabilities of
                                    the Spring bottle, the team can use positive reinforcement by giving out rewards
                                    like shop vouchers to users who are consistently meeting their hydration goals.</li>
                                <li>The stakeholders might consider launching larger Spring bottle sizes given the
                                    findings from the analysis. Users might consider a larger bottle size given the fact
                                    that they might refill their current Spring bottles multiple times throughout the
                                    day.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <b>Future analysis</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Using company data taken from actual Bellabeat products for future analysis efforts is
                            recommended.</li>
                        <li>Insights gained from the average weight of users might be inaccurate due to a small sample
                            size. Also, other information such as age and gender should be considered given that
                            company’s products are targeted for women. It can be helpful to consider other data sources
                            that provide more information about users’ profiles.</li>
                        <li>Including data about water intake from Spring bottles can be useful for future analysis.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
