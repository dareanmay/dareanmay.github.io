						<h1>PH Food Prices &#129477;</h1>
						<p>An Activity from the Bayan Academy Data Analytics Certification</p>
					</header>

					<p>The purpose of this project is to practice my data cleaning, visualization, and
						analysis skills gained from the data analytics training provided by Bayan Academy. I intend to
						gain insights from the data provided by the World Food Programme Price Database which
						covers foods such as maize, rice, beans, fish, and sugar from 98 countries and some 3000
						markets.
					</p>
					<p>The extracted <a
							href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices-for-philippines" target = "_blank">dataset</a> from the
						said database contains basic information about food prices of 66
						kinds of basic food commodities in the Philippines from 2000 – 2023 across several markets,
						localities, and regions in the country.
					</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Data cleaning</h2>
					<p>Below are some of the major steps I did to clean the data using Power Query in Microsoft Excel:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Organized header row and columns</li>
						<li>Filtered out dates with blank values of food commodity prices and trimmed white spaces</li>
						<li>Transformed and replaced names and values of some data entries</li>
						<li>Fixed formatting of names of food commodities through various steps:
							<ul>
								<li>split columns by delimiter</li>
								<li>grouped similar food commodities for simplification</li>
								<li>renamed unfamiliar names of some food commodities into more common names in Tagalog or English</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					Click <a
						href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1VuDzKEV_rKLkRveh-lTaJdocCjiQf7gs" target = "_blank">here</a>
					to access the Excel file.

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Data visualization</h2>
					<p>For the visualization and analysis, data will be limited from the years 2018 – 2022 to provide a
						more current and relevant overview of the trend and changes in the food prices from recent
						years. The data was visualized using Tableau, as shown below. The dashboard below shows the
						overview of trends in food prices in the country for all the food commodities included in the
						dataset. The dashboard view can be filtered based on what food commodity you want to look at.

					<h2>Data exploration</h2>
					As an example EDA, I would like to explore the functionality of the dashboard by examining the
					change in food prices for one of the more controversial food commodities that dramatically became
					more expensive in the country last year – <b>red onions</b>.
					</p>

					<p>It should be taken note that for most of the food commodities, price is based on a quantity of
						one kilogram of food. For oil products, quantity is based on 750 mL of the food item. For
						eggs, average price is based on one piece of egg.
					</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Data questions</h2>
					<p>Here are a few questions specific to the price of red onions that I would like to gain insights
						from by the end of this analysis:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>How do the average price of red onions commodities vary by locality or region? Which places
							in
							the country had the most expensive and cheapest average price for red onions?</li>
						<li>How do the average price of red onions commodities vary by time? When did the sudden
							increase of
							average price of red onions occur? </li>
						<li>What is the national average price of red onions?</li>
					</ol>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Data findings and insights</h2>

					<b>Average price of red onions by locality and region</b></br>
					<ol>
						<li>Region VIII (Eastern Visayas) recorded the highest average price of one kilo of onions -
							P153.74, while Region II (Cagayan Valley) had the lowest average price of P117.50.</li>
						<li>Based on locality, Camiguin from Region X (Northern Mindanao) recorded the highest average
							price of red onions with P177.88. Palayan, Nueva Ecija from Region III (Central Luzon) had
							the lowest with P71.98.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<b>Average price of red onions by month and year</b></br>
					<ol>
						<li>There is a general upward trend for the average price of a kilogram of red onions in the
							country from 2018-2022.
						</li>
						<li>The highest recorded average price for a kilo of red onions is on December 2022, with an
							all-time high of P306.70. The lowest average price of P64.33 was recorded from May – April
							2019.
						</li>
						<li>The average price for red onions had the most noticeable fluctuations around the end of 2020
							up to
							the end of 2022. Around the beginning and end of the year are the points on the line where
							prices were the highest. The steepest increase is seen by the end of 2022.
						</li>
						<li>The average price increased by 43.09% from January 2022 to December 2022.</li>
					</ol>

					<b>National average price of red onions</b></br>
					<ol>
						<li>From 2018-2022, the national average price of red onions is P136.73.</li>
					</ol>

					<b>Other interesting insights</b></br>
					<ol>
						<li>In December 2022, the average price of a kilogram of red onions is more expensive than a
							kilogram of pork and also more expensive than a kilogram of chicken. The average price of a
							kilogram of beef is roughly only P50.00 more expensive than a kilogram of red onions.
						</li>
						<li>For the price of one kilogram of red onions in December 2022, you can buy almost three and
							a half kilos of red onions around the same time in 2018.
						</li>
						<li>A kilogram of red onions was P381.00 in the markets of Davao De Oro on December 2022,
							the highest recorded price. In contrast, you can buy the cheapest kilo of red onions for
							P39.00 in the markets of Palayan, Nueva Ecija on April 2019.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
					<p>Food security and food affordability is critical to quality of life and sustainability. The
						sudden increase of food commodities, like that of onions last year, is something that should be
						resolved through the creation of data-driven policies and solutions.
					</p>
					<p>The insights that I have provided are just descriptive insights on how prices of red onions have
						changed. Further data exploration and analysis can be made to see what influences change in food
						prices that can help predict how prices can change over time.
