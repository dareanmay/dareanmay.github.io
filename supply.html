                    </header>

                    <p>This project is made as an effort to practice my basic skills in SQL. The <a
                            href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/dataco-smart-supply-chain-for-big-data-analysis?select=DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv" target = "_blank">dataset</a>,
                        I chose to practice on consists of more than 180,000 records of supply chain activities from
                        DataCo Global. I intend to organize the data into a dashboard to find insights on product
                        distribution and sales across different supply chain categories.</p>

                    <p>Data cleaning and exploration was primarily done using Microsoft SQL Server and the data is
                        linked to Microsoft Power BI for data visualization.</p>
