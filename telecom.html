						<h1>Telecom Customer Churn &#128225;</h1>
						<p>An EDA and Dashboard Project inspired by the Maven Churn Challenge</p>
					</header>

					<p>
						This data exploration and visualization project is inspired by a <a
							href="https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-churn-challenge" target = "_blank">data challenge</a> I found
						from Maven Analytics. The dataset provided contains churn data from 7,043 customers from a
						fictional telecommunications company in California in the second quarter of 2022. Information
						provided about the customers include their demographics, location, tenure, subscription
						services, status for the quarter (joined, stayed, or churned), and more.
					</p>
					<p>
						In this scenario challenge, I am tasked to find insights on the following to improve customer
						retention:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Identify high-value customers. </b>In this analysis, I would define customers as
							“high-value”
							based on these factors – retention rate, revenue, sales, and number of referrals.</li>
						<li><b>Identify top reasons for churn. </b>I would explore the customer data based on
							demographics, customer behavior, and sales to identify which are more likely to contribute
							to customer churn.</li>
					</ol>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Data cleaning</h2>
					<p>The following are some of the major steps I did using Power Query in Microsoft Excel to clean and
						transform the data:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Added entries to some identified blank cells that can be filled in with values</li>
						<li>Assigned categorical names for some numerical data such as age, number of dependents,
							referrals, tenure, and average download consumption using conditional columns</li>
						<li>Replaced data in columns containing ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ entries into more descriptive names
							(e.g., subscribed, not subscribed)</li>
						<li>Separated the dataset into different tables based on demographics, product, account, and
							churn data using customer ID as a primary key for Tableau visualization</li>
					</ul>
					Click <a
						href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1C4ZaeMekzvNMSiGAmgJvo5bGzTuoyRWU" target = "_blank">here</a>
					to access the Excel file.

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Data questions</h2>
					<p>Below are the general questions I would like to find insights on in the analysis of the churn
						data:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>What are the overall customer churn rate, retention rate, and acquisition rate of the
							telecommunications company?</li>
						<li>What are the top reasons for customer churn?</li>
						<li>What factors based on demographics, customer behavior, and sales influence customer churn,
							retention, and acquisition?</li>
					</ol>
					<p>To guide my data exploration and dashboard creation, the following questions about the data are
						specified:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>What is the distribution of customers based on demographic factors?</li>
						<li>What is the distribution of customers based on product/service subscriptions, marketing
							offers, and streaming service usage?</li>
						<li>What is the distribution of customers based on account activity and sales?</li>
					</ol>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Data visualization</h2>
					<p>The final Tableau dashboard is shown below. The viewer can hover over the graphs to see more
						information on churn rate, retention rate, acquisition rate, revenue, tenure, referrals, and
						more. Legends can also be accessed by hovering over chart titles. The dashboard sections are

					<h2>Data findings and insights</h2>
					<b>Customer churn overview</b></br>
					<ol>
						<li>Most of the customers did not churn by the end of the second quarter of the year, with a
							retention rate of 67.02%. Customers in this category contributed an average of $3,735.68 in
							revenue. On average, retained customers have been with the company for 41 months and
							referred the company to 3 people.</li>
						<li>6.45% of the company’s customers are new this quarter and have an average tenure of 2
							months.</li>
						<li>Almost a third of the company churned by the end of the quarter, with a churn rate of
							26.54%. Compared to the customers who stayed, average revenue, tenure, and number of
							referrals are generally less. Most of the churned customers are low spenders, are newcomers,
							and have not referred the company to other people.</li>
						<li>The top reason for churn is preference of customers to competitor. According to 45% of
							churned customers, the competitor offer better devices, better offers, more data, and higher
							download speeds.</li>
					</ol>
					<b>Customer demographics</b></br>
					<ol>
						<li>In terms of age, most of the customers belong to the mid-adulthood age group (36-55 years
							old).</li>
						<li>Even though the customer distribution is almost evenly split in terms of civil status,
							single customers are more likely to churn (17.038%) than married customers.</li>
						<li>76.90% of the customer base do not have dependents.</li>
						<li>The city with the highest churn rate is San Diego (2.627%), while the city with the
							highest retention rate is Los Angeles (2.797%).</li>
					</ol>
					<b>Customer subscriptions</b></br>
					<ol>
						<li>Phone subscribers comprise of 90.32% of the customers. Internet subscribers are 78.33% of
							the customer base. 68.65% are subscribed to both phone and internet services.</li>
						<li>Internet subscription is slightly higher in revenue to phone subscription despite the fact
							that there are more phone subscribers. Churn rates between both phone and internet
							subscribers are close to around 24%, with internet subscribers being slightly higher
							(24.93%).</li>
						<li>Churn rates for subscribers availing of other subscriptions such as premium tech support,
							device protection plan, online security, and online backup are generally less compared to
							customers who are not subscribed.</li>
					</ol>
					<b>Customer offers</b></br>
					<ol>
						<li>Overall acceptance rate of customers to marketing offers is 44.95%. The most accepted
							offers are Offer B (11.70%) and Offer E (11.43%), while Offer C is the least accepted
							(5.892%).</li>
						<li>Customers who accepted Offer E churned the most with a churn rate of 6.049%.</li>
						<li>10.266% of customers who accepted Offer B stayed with the company, having the highest
							retention rate among all the marketing offers.</li>
					</ol>
					<b>Customer streaming and data usage</b></br>
					<ol>
						<li>The average monthly data download is 20.52 GB, enforcing the fact that most of the
							customers who are internet subscribers are heavy data users.</li>
						<li>Majority of internet subscribers are subscribed to unlimited data (67.37%).</li>
						<li>Customers who use their internet to stream movies and TV have lower churn rates.</li>
					</ol>
					<b>Customer account activity and sales</b></br>
					<ol>
						<li>The average tenure of customers is 32 months. Overall, customers who have longer tenure
							like regulars, loyalists, and elite customers churn less compared to newcomers.</li>
						<li>Likewise, customers who have longer tenure are more inclined to refer the company to other
							people. The average number of referrals is 2.</li>
						<li>Customers with shorter contracts like month-to-month basis have higher risk of churning,
							with a churn rate of 23.50%.</li>
						<li>Majority of customers are low spenders. These low spenders also churn more compared to
							customers who pay more for products and other charges.</li>
					</ol>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
					<p>Given the tasks I set myself to do in the beginning of this project, here are my final
						conclusions about the analysis:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>High-value customers are those who have been loyal to the company, or those who have
								longer average tenure. </b>Based from customer behavior and sales data, customers with
							longer
							tenure are more likely to spend more on products and services and are more active in
							referring the company to other people. Customers also churn less the longer their tenure.
							The company should incentivize customers who have been with them the longest and think of
							ways to cater their products and services towards them.</li>
						<li><b>The top reason for churn is because of the company’s competitor/s. </b>Areas of weakness
							identified by customers are the company’s devices, offers, data, and download speeds. As
							majority of the customers consume high amounts of data, the company should find ways to
							improve their internet services. Also, the company should look into subscriptions and offers
							that have affected their churn and retention. For example, something should be improved
							about Offer E because of the amount of churn it produced. On the other hand, the company
							should take note of Offer B because of how it performed well in terms of customer retention.
						</li>
					</ol>
